# PyCity Schools Analysis

This challenge involves creating and manipulating Pandas DataFrames to analyse schools and standardised test data.
The area-wide standardised test results are analysed and the given student's maths and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools are used to aggregate the data, showcasing obvious trends in school performance.
A summary of the analysis is at the top of the page in the Jupyter Notebook.
